Custom Calculator in Java ðŸ§®
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Custom Calculator in Java, using custom exceptions to handle invalid arithmetic operations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”with custom business rules and validation.

ðŸš€ Features
Perform four basic arithmetic operations.

Validate inputs based on custom logic:

Prevent adding 9 and 8 together.

Prevent subtraction if either number is zero.

Prevent multiplication if both numbers are 0.

Prevent division by 0.

Limit values:

Addition, Subtraction, Division: Inputs must be â‰¤ 100,000.

Multiplication: Inputs must be â‰¤ 7,000.
